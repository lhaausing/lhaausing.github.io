## About Me

Hi this is Haau-Sing Li/Xiaocheng Li/李效丞/이효성!

I am currently an [ELLIS PhD](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) student. My affiliations under ELLIS are [UKP Lab @ TU Darmstadt](https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/) (with **Iryna Gurevych**) and [SARDINE Lab @ Instituto de Telecomunicações](https://sardine-lab.github.io/) (with **André Martins**, as part of [Lisbon ELLIS Unit](https://lumlis.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/)).

My research revolves around the study of **Code Generation**, **Test-Time Compute**, and **Reasoning**. I have a decent level of confidence that the domain knowledge of code generation can be used to improve the performance of language models with respect to reasoning, problem-solving, agent-related tasks, and more.

Before joining the ELLIS PhD program, I finished my master's degree at [Center for Data Science, NYU](https://cds.nyu.edu/alumni-spotlights/), where I worked with **Alex Warstadt** and **Sam Bowman** on NLU and **Narges Razavian** on medical NLP. I have my bachelor's degree at **Renmin University of China**.
